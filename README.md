# README #

MenuBar Translate is a very simple app that lets you have a quick shortcut to Google Translate in your OS X menu bar and integrate it with the OS X "Services" menu. Its main purpose is to allow you to have Google Translate by hand at all times, without needing to open a new browser window.

One click, and you're ready to translate.

The app has no tracking at all (well, except the one that Google will do on the Translate instance loaded in the embedded WebView - but nothing by me). Code-wise it might also serve you as a blueprint to implement a embedded webview, with a service to receive text from other contexts.

## Contributing

The project just solves a personal need I have: I am Spanish and live abroad (first in The Netherlands, now in Denmark), so often I need to translate texts or words I don't know yet.

If this project is useful for you and you would like to get it improved, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/zetxek/osx-menubar-translate/issues), or [open a PR](https://github.com/zetxek/osx-menubar-translate/pulls) straight away. It will be more than welcome!
